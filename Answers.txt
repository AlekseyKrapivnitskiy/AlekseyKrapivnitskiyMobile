5.I did not change anything, tests works fine on my real device.

6.Required Actions:
    1)Start Appium Server.
    2)Connect device to PC.
    3)Check that device is connected via adb devices.
    4)Click on 'Start Inspector Session' button.
    5)Fill Desired Capabilities with valid data.
    6)Click on 'Start Session' button.

I did not found any differences with run on emulator or my device.
